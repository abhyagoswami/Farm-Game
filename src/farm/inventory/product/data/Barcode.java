 * Collection of constant barcodes representing all product types a farm can choose to stock.

 * A barcode identifies a specific type of product, and is common to all individual products
 * of that type (e.g. all eggs have the same barcode). Barcodes also store other constant data
 * associated with that type of product, such as its display name and base price.
 * <p>
 * <b>Note:</b> Barcodes are (obviously) typically numeric, but for our purposes enums serve
 * the same purpose without requiring that we write a unique integer generator or similar. We 
 * could of course make a method to give us an equivalent numeric code that more closely resembles
 * a real physical barcode, but that would be redundant, since we can use the enum members 
 * themselves anywhere that such a code might be expected.
