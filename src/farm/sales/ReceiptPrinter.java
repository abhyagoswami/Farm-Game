     *     of the receipt, in the order (from left to right) in which they should appear on the receipt. For example, 
     *     if a headings list is provided beginning with "Name", then the leftmost heading of the products section
     *     will be "Name". All headings will always appear on the same line.</li>
     *     <li><strong>Entries:</strong> Provide a list of the entries to be displayed in the body of the 'purchases' section, 
     *     beneath the provided headings. Each entry should be a list of strings, with each item in the list 
     *     being the piece of information corresponding to the heading at the same index.
     *     <br>
     *     For example, if the first heading in the headings list is "Name", and the first list in the entries list 
     *     is ["Milk", "$4.40"], then "Milk" is the piece of information corresponding to the "Name" heading in the first entry.
     *     <br>
     *     Each entry occupies its own line, unless that entry contains more items than there are headings; in this case, 
     *     the entry 'wraps around' to the next line. For example, if there are two headings and some entry contains three items, 
     *     then the third string in that entry would instead be shown at the start of the <em>next</em> line.
     *     </li>
     *     <li><strong>Total:</strong> The string to be displayed as the total cost of the whole transaction.</li>
     *     <li><strong>Customer name:</strong> The string to be displayed as the customer's name.</li>
     * </ol>
     * Note: This method makes no changes to the <em>formatting of any of the supplied strings.</em>
     * All supplied strings must already be in the format in which they are to be displayed.
     * @param headings the headings to be shown at the top of all purchases listed on the receipt
     * @param entries the entries to be displayed in the purchases section of the receipt. Each
     *                entry is a list of strings that will be displayed in the same column as the 
     *                headings at the corresponding index of the headings list.
